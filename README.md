# SRV-planning
Repository to plan and coordinate some of the Science Release and Validation Working Group (SRV WG) tasks
Issues will contain brainstorming and conversations on SRV planning. Also RFCs for specific input on options for decisions we have to take.

The SRV WG landing page in SLAC's Confluence can be found at: https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Science+Release+and+Validation
